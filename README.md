Rubinary
========

***Because what if + stopped working...?***

Inspired by reading about how to build an adding machine out of logic gates in Charles Petzold's [Code:
The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/), I've tried to do the same in Ruby just to test myself a little, refresh my memory and also play with how best to structure a computer program

So here's how to add two numbers together in Ruby without using +!

At the moment it's all stil very basic, a series of methods sitting in one file, but we're as far as adding two binaries of any length together.

Stay posted...

So what will it do when it's done?
----------------------------------

- Add numbers up without using any of the Ruby maths operators
- Do the same for subtraction
- We got this far, why not multiplication?
- ... and division too!
- Have an easy to read structure which will demonstrate the electronic engineering principles behind computing (ish).
- Work on the command line
- Accept integers, strings of 0s and 1s, and even arrays of 0s and 1s as strings and/or integers.
- Validate the above input and show a nice message telling you where you went wrong
