Rubinary

*Because what if + stopped working...?*
---------------------------------------

Inspired by reading about how to build an adding machine out of logic gates in Charles Petzold's [Code:
The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/), I've tried to do the same in Ruby just to test myself a little and refresh my memory.

At the moment it's all stil very basic, and sitting in one file, but we're as far as adding two binaries of nay length together. Stay posted.
